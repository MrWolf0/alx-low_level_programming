# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03. C - Debugging)
* [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x08-recursion](./0x08-recursion)
* [0x09-static_libraries](./0x09-static_libraries)
* [0x0A-argc_argv](./0x0A-argc_argv)
* [0x0B-malloc_free](./0x0B-malloc_free)
* [0x0C-more_malloc_free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)
* [0x0D-preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor)
* [0x0E-structures_typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef)
* [0x10-variadic_functions](./0x10-variadic_functions)
* [0x12-singly_linked_lists](./0x12-singly_linked_lists)
